# Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

## About the Repository

This is a repository of my professional portfolio. Inside the deployed application, you will find a responsive and accessible webpage using flexboxes, media queries, CSS variables, and JavaScript functions through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using VSCode. You will also see my artistic design in action through color schemes, typography, personalized logos, a recent photo of myself and images that link you to my projects.

Creating this webpage has not been easy, but it has been so beneficial in helping me discover what I can do and that even if I don't know how to do something, I can effectively research and problem solve to accomplish a goal and vision. 

## Acceptance Criteria
For this project, I was given a set of critical requirements to satisfy a typical hiring manager's needs. They are as follows:

## Description and Credits 

To create this portfolio, I sought help from multiple resources, which include:

Navigation Bar:
* w3schools: I used https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_topnav.asp to help me understand the basics of HTML and CSS syntax. 
* YouTube - Web Dev Simplified (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At4B7A4GOPg): I found a great video on YouTube by Web Dev Simplified, which walked me through the process of how to implement the navigation bar with a hamburger menu. These skills were implemented in my CSS and Javascript file using the classes ".navbar," ".links," and "hamburger-menu." 

About Me Section:
* Profile Photo: I used the website https://imagecolorpicker.com/ to draw out colors to create a cohesive color scheme throughout my portfolio.
* Flexbox Column Display: I used this stackoverflow.com link (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54548666/how-can-i-make-my-two-boxes-in-the-same-row) to help me make my boxes sit next to each other on a desktop screen. 
* w3schools (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox_responsive.asp): I used this link from w3schools to help me add a media query to make the boxes display in a column at 768px. 
 
My Work Section:
* My work cards: For this section, I drew inspiration from a previous activity we did during one of our lectures on Advanced CSS. The activity was "04-Stu_Flexbox-Layout" as well as activity "10-Stu_Box-Styling". In the flexbox layout activity, we learned how to create boxes within a container that would flex when applying "display: flex" and "flex-wrap: wrap" in its CSS code. In the box styling activity, we learned how to add images and headers inside of a flexbox as well as style the boxes with the "border-radius" property. These skills were implemented in my work with the classes labeled. ".worksection" and ".mywork"
* Image Opacity: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_transparency.asp

Contact Me Section:
* I implemented the same knowledge I got from YouTube - Web Dev Simplified (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At4B7A4GOPg) to add hover over the clickable links in my footer. 

reset.css File:
* I used the reset.css stylesheet from our previous in class activity "12-Stu_CSS-Resets."

Overall: 
* I collaborated with my study group from class on debugging and refining my id/class naming conventions.

README.md file:
* I used the following link to help me with the layout for this README file:
